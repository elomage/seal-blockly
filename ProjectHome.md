We are extending [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/seal-blockly/) for SEAL script support (a declarative language for wireless sensor networks).

SEAL is supported by [MansOS](http://mansos.net) operating system.

[Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/seal-blockly/) is a nice project for a visual programming editor.
